Python Examples
===============

Server-side
^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Sample server-side code:

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 url = 'amqp://localhost'
 address = 'test'
 agent = Agent(url, address)


Define Agent-side
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample agent-side code.  This module is placed in ``/user/share/gofer/plugins/`` along with a plugin
descriptor in ``/etc/gofer/plugins/``

Plugin descriptor: ``/etc/gofer/plugins/plugin.conf``

::

 [main]
 enabled=1

 [messaging]
 url=amqp://localhost

 [model]
 queue=test


Code:   ``/user/share/gofer/plugins/plugin.py``

::

 from gofer.decorators import remote
 from gofer.rmi.model.FORK
 from gofer.agent.plugin import Plugin

 # (optional) access to the plugin descriptor
 # which you can use to define custom sections/properties

 plugin = Plugin.find(__name__)

 class Dog:

    @remote
    def bark(self, words):
        woof = cfg.dog.bark_noise
        print '%s %s' % (woof, words)
        return 'Yes master.  I will bark because that is what dogs do.'

    @remote(model=FORK)
    def wag(self, n):
        for i in range(0, n):
            print 'wag'
        return 'Yes master.  I will wag my tail because that is what dogs do.'


The plugin may be loaded from the PYTHON path by specifying the *plugin* property in
descriptor as follows:

::

 [main]
 enabled=1
 plugin=application.agent.plugin.py

 [messaging]
 url=amqp://localhost

 [model]
 queue=zoo


Synchronous Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample of server code invoking synchronously methods (remotely) on the agent.  This is the default
behaviour and the timeout is 90 seconds by default.

Python
------

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'test')

 # invoke methods on the agent (remotely)

 dog = agent.Dog()
 print dog.bark('hello')
 print dog.wag(3)
 print dog.bark('hello')

 # methods that raise exceptions

 try:
    print dog.sit()
 except Exception, e:
    print repr(e)

 try:
    print dog.not_permitted()
 except Exception, e:
    print repr(e)


Using the CLI
-------------

::

 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -t Dog.bark hello
 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -t Dog.wag 3
 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -t Dog.bark hello


Synchronous Invocation (specify timeout)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample of server code invoking synchronously methods (remotely) on the agent with a
timeout of 180 seconds.

Python
------

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 amqp://localhost
 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'test', wait=180)  # specify timeout

 # invoke methods on the agent (remotely)
 dog = agent.Dog()
 dog.bark('hello')
 dog.wag(3)
 dog.bark('hello')


Using the CLI
-------------

::

 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -w 180 -t Dog.bark hello
 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -w 180 -t Dog.wag 3
 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -w 180 -t Dog.bark hello


Asynchronous (fire & forget) Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample of server code invoking synchronously methods (remotely) on the agent.  This works the same for
asynchronous *fire-and-forget* where not reply is wanted.  Asynchronous invocation returns the serial
number of the request.

Python
------

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 # create an agent where user data = 'task_id'
 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'test', wait=0)

 # invoke methods on the agent (remotely)
 dog = agent.Dog()
 dog.bark('hello')
 dog.wag(3)
 print dog.bark('hello')
    'e688f50b-3108-43dd-9a57-813f434749a8'

 # methods that raise exceptions
 try:
    print dog.sit()
 except Exception, e:
    print repr(e)

 try:
    print dog.not_permitted()
 except Exception, e:
    print repr(e)


Using the CLI
-------------

::

 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -w 0 -t Dog.bark hello
 e688f50b-3108-43dd-9a57-813f434749a8


Asynchronous (callback) Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sample of server code invoking asynchronously methods (remotely) on the agent.   The is the *callback*
form of asynchronous invocation.  This example uses a *Listener* class.   But, the *listener* can also
be any *callable*.  Asynchronous invocation returns the serial number of the request to be used by
the caller to further correlate request & response.

Python
------

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent
 from gofer.messaging.async import ReplyConsumer

 # specify a reply address to be used for asynchronous responses.

 reply_to = 'tasks'

 # create my listener class

 class Listener:
    """
    An asynchronous operation callback listener.
    """

    def succeeded(self, reply):
        """
        Async request succeeded.
        :param reply: The reply data.
        :type reply: Succeeded.
        """
        pass

    def failed(self, reply):
        """
        Async request failed (raised an exception).
        :param reply: The reply data.
        :type reply: Failed.
        """
        pass

    def accepted(self, reply):
        """
        Async request has been accepted.
        :param reply: The request.
        :type reply: Accepted.
        """
        pass

    def rejected(self, reply):
        """
        Async request has been rejected.
        :param reply: The request.
        :type reply: Accepted.
        """
        pass

    def started(self, reply):
        """
        Async request has started.
        :param reply: The request.
        :type reply: Started.
        """
        pass

    def progress(self, reply):
        """
        Async progress report.
        :param reply: The request.
        :type reply: Progress.
        """
        pass


 # create my reply consumer using the reply to and my listener

 reader = ReplyConsumer(reply_to)
 reader.start(Listener())

 # create an agent where user data is {'task_id': 1234} and
 # setup for asynchronous invocation with my reply address.

 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'test', reply=reply_to)

 # invoke methods on the agent (remotely)
 dog = agent.Dog()
 dog.bark('hello')
 dog.wag(3)
 print dog.bark('hello')
    'e688f50b-3108-43dd-9a57-813f434749a8'


Same asynchronous example except specify a *callable* as the listener.  Also, it uses the *throw()*
method on reply.

::

 # specify a reply address to be used for responses.

 reply_to = 'tasks'

 # create my listener

 def callback(reply):
    try:
        reply.throw()
        ...
        print reply.retval # succeeded, do something with return value.
        ...
    except Exception, ex:
        # handle general exception
        pass

 # create my reply consumer using the reply address and my callback

 reader = ReplyConsumer(reply_to)
 reader.start(callback)
 ...


Using the CLI
-------------

Note: ``-r tasks``

::

 $ gofer rmi -u 'amqp://localhost' -a test -w 0 -r tasks -t Dog.bark hello
 e688f50b-3108-43dd-9a57-813f434749a8



Class Constructor Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Classes defined in the agent can have constructor arguments.  Though, remember, an instance is constructed
for each request so remote objects are stateless.  The *stub* provides for passing __init__() arguments by
calling the *stub*.

Examples:

In the plugin:

::

 class Dog:

  def __init__(self, name, age=1):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  @remote
  def bark(self):
    pass

  @remote
  def wag():
    pass


Calling:

::

 ...
 dog = agent.Dog()      # stub constructor, pass gofer options here.
 dog('rover', age=10)   # constructor arguments set here.
 dog.bark('hello')
 dog.wag()

 # change the constructor arguments and call something else.

 dog('max', age=5)   # changing constructor arguments.
 dog.bark('howdy')


Subsequent calls simply update the constructor arguments.

This:

::

 dog('rover', age=10)


equals this (in the agent):

::

 dog = Dog('rover', age=10)


Progress Reporting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In gofer 0.72+ remote method progress can be reported by plugins.  In the case of synchronous RMI, the caller
can specify a *callback* for progress reporting by specifying the *progress* option.  The *callback* must
take a single (dict) parameter (report).

The report has the following keys:

- **sn** - *serial number*
- **any** - *user data*
- **total** - *the number total units*
- **completed** - *the number of completed units*
- **details** - *arbitrary details*

For asynchronous RMI, the *listener* is called with progress reports.

Examples:

::

 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 def progress_reported(report)
  pass

 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'test')
 dog = agent.Dog(progress=progress_reported)
 dog.bark('howdy')


On the agent, plugins report progress from with a method by using the *Progress* object defined within
the current call *Context*.

Example:

::

 from gofer.agent.rmi import Context
 from gofer.decorators import remote

 class MyClass:

    @remote
    def foo(self):
        """
        Do something reports progress
        """
        total = 10
        # get the call context
        ctx = Context.current()
        ctx.progress.total = total
        # demo reporting progress for 10 units
        for n in range(0, total):
            ctx.progress.completed += 1
            sleep(1)

    @remote
    def bar(self):
        """
        Do something reports progress with details.
        """
        total = 10
        # get the call context
        ctx = Context.current()
        ctx.progress.total = total
        # demo reporting progress for 10 units
        for n in range(0, total):
            ctx.progress.completed += 1
            ctx.progress.details='for: %d' % n)
            sleep(1)


Testing
^^^^^^^

Logs
----

After adding/updating classes or methods in myplugin.py, you'll want to test them.  First, ensure the
plugin is still loading properly.  The easiest way to do this is by examining the gofer log file
at: ``/var/log/gofer/agent``.  At start up, you should see something like:

::

 2010-11-08 08:49:04,491 [WARNING][MainThread] __mangled() @ plugin.py:122 - "pulp" found in python-path
 2010-11-08 08:49:04,503 [INFO][MainThread] __mangled() @ plugin.py:123 - "pulp" mangled to avoid collisions
 2010-11-08 08:49:04,909 [INFO][MainThread] __import() @ plugin.py:103 - plugin "pulp", imported as: "pulp_plugin"


Either the gofer log or the pulp client.log may be examined to verify that *Actions* are
running as expected.

Interactive Shell
-----------------

Testing added/updated *remote methods*, can be done easily using an interactive python (shell).
Be sure your changes to the pulp plugin have been picked up by *Gofer* by **restarting goferd**.
Let's say you added a new class named "Foo" that has a remote method named ... you guessed it: "bar".

You can test your new stuff as follows:

::

 [jortel@localhost pulp]$ python
 Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, Jun  4 2010, 18:28:04)
 [GCC 4.4.3 20100127 (Red Hat 4.4.3-4)] on linux2
 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 >>> from gofer.proxy import Agent
 >>> address = <agent queue>
 >>> agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', address)
 >>> foo = agent.Foo()
 >>> print foo.bar()


Or, using the proxy module API:

::

 [jortel@localhost pulp]$ python
 Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, Jun  4 2010, 18:28:04)
 [GCC 4.4.3 20100127 (Red Hat 4.4.3-4)] on linux2
 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 >>> from gofer import proxy
 >>> address = <agent queue>
 >>> agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', address)
 >>> foo = agent.Foo()
 >>> print foo.bar()

Admin.help()
------------

Another useful tool, it invoke *Admin.help()* from within interactive python as follows:

::

 [jortel@localhost pulp]$ python
 Python 2.6.2 (r262:71600, Jun  4 2010, 18:28:04)
 [GCC 4.4.3 20100127 (Red Hat 4.4.3-4)] on linux2
 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
 >>> from pulp.server.agent import Agent
 >>> address = <agent queue>
 >>> agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', address)
 >>> admin = agent.Admin()
 >>> print admin.help()

 Plugins:
   demo
   pulp [pulp_admin]
 Actions:
   demo.TestAction 0:10:00
 Methods:
   custom.Dog.bark()
   custom.Dog.wag()
   demo.Admin.hello()
   demo.Admin.help()
   demo.Shell.run()
 Functions:
   demo.echo()
 >>>


Test Main
---------

The ``test/main.py`` module provides a good testing entry point that does not require the process owner
to be root.

Mocks
-----

The gofer *mock* feature provides better testability.  Essentially, it allows uses to test the
server-side code that uses the gofer proxy.  Instead of calling through to the remote agent,
RMI calls can be mocked-up.

Added 0.33.

The *mock* module provides an API for registering custom *stub* mocks.

Items that can be registered with *mock*.register():

- instance (object)
- class
- module

Example:

::

 from gofer.messaging import mock
 mock.install()
 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 agent = Agent('xyz')

 # define mock impl for testing
 class Dog:
    def bark(self, msg):
        return 'mock Dog, called with: [%s]' % msg

 # register our mock class
 mock.register(Dog=Dog)

 # call bark()

 dog = agent.Dog()

 print dog.bark('hello')
   'mock Dog, called with: [hello]'

 print dog.bark('world')
   'mock Dog, called with: [world]'

 #
 # now, let look at the call history
 #

 h =  dog.bark.history()
 print h
  '[("hello",),{}), ("world",),{})]'

 # get last call
 last = h[-1]

 # look at the passed args
 print last.args[0]
  'world'

 # look at the keyword args
 print last.kwargs
  '{}'


It's very important to note the difference between registering a class (as a stub) and an instance
(as a stub).  In short, nstances are shared across all *mock* agents and classes are associated to
the instance of the *mock* agent that created them.  That way, call history is scoped to *mock*
agent as well.

In some cases, it's useful to have a stub method raise an exception.  Here's how it's done:

::

 from gofer.messaging import mock
 mock.install()
 from gofer.proxy import Agent

 agent = Agent('amqp://localhost', 'xyz')

 # define mock impl for testing
 class Dog:

    def bark(self, msg):
        return 'mock Dog, called with: [%s]' % msg

 # register our mock class
 mock.register(Dog=Dog)

 dog = agent.Dog()

 # call bark() normally
 print dog.bark('hello')

 # now, let's have it raise an exception

 dog.bark.push(Exception('no more barking'))
 try:
    dog.bark('hello')
 except Exception, e:
   print e
   '"no more barking'"
